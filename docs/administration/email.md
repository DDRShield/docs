# Creating a ddrgov.red Email Account

Creating a `ddrgov.red` email account can be incredibly useful for splitting DDR Accounts from IRL
Accounts. DDRGOV Accounts are flexible and allow you to:

- Create a unique, DDR themed email account or create a simple redirect email (test@ddrgov.red would
  send email to test@outlook.com)
- Use SHIELD2 Based Login Services
- Take advantage of Department Level Email Addresses (@defence.ddrgov.red, @interior.ddrgov.red)
